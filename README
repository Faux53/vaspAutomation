In order to properly run this you need to follow some steps

1). grab shutil, running the setupauto.py script should get you the current version of shutil

2). make sure you have the correct version of Python,  Python 3 will NOT work, for this script we need python 2.7 which has glob

3). add in your own folder path line 5 into the automation.py mine is /Users/andrewadams/Desktop/vasp/dir  yours may be different.

4). count the characters in your file path, add 8 and replace 43 with it on line 10

5). you should be good to run it.
